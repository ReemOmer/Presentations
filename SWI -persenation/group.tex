\textbf{Classifier}: is function that takes data as input and assign labels to it as output.\\
- To write classifier automatically is called supervised learning.\\
- Classifier finds the patterns in the input data.\newline \newline
\textbf{Types of classifiers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Artificial Neural Networks;
\item Support Vector Machine;
\item Decision Tree;
\item ...
